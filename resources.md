  <li> What is AR and What they can do?</li>
  <p><a href="https://arvr.google.com/ar/">What is AR</a></p>
  
  <li>This is the application of AR technology on the map. We can better understand this area by modifying the layer. We can see the landform, surrounding scenic spots and other things</li>
  <p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@43.8006579,-79.3614688,8798m/data=!3m1!1e3!5m2!1e3!1e4?hl=zh_cn">AR on Map</a></p>
  
  <li>As one of the most close technological ways to human life, AR is applied in many places. Apple is one of the largest ar platforms in the world, with tens of thousands of devices. Many of Apple's software uses AR technology, such as DSLR Camera，JigSpace. </li>
  <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/augmented-reality/">Apple</a></p>
  
  <li>Tesla's website uses AR technology to watch car models. Moreover, musk put forward the idea that AR technology will be used with Tesla as early as 2016, which is very interesting. I think that when Tesla is equipped with AR view, car owners can see the car condition more intuitively</li>
  <p><a href="https://virsabi.com/tesla/">Tesla</a></p>
  
  <li> VR is different to AR, however, they still have the same technology. For my thought, I think VR is fake, AR is true, this is the Intuitive features.Because augmented reality and virtual reality are two distinct concepts.</li>

<h1> Artistic/design/aesthetic resources </h1>
<li>In the film, we can see some special technology about AR. The operation interface of armor is one of the manifestations of AR, which maps the screen to the front</li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ugaeA-nMTc">Iron man</a></p>

<li>These are some street art,people can use their imagine do some interesting things. For example, people can draw on the wall or ground and Interact with existing scenarios. Like Drawing a hole in the ground and pretending to fall down is also a kind of street art.</li> 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0N4LVynvvM">Street art<a/></p>


<li>This is Pokemon go，It is a very classic ar game, which uses the camera of the mobile phone to capture the real scene, and then play.</li>
<p><a href="https://pokemongolive.com/">Pokemon Go</a></p>

<li>Amazing video. In addition to AR technology, I think this video shows a series of special effects such as ray tracing, which is very shocking. Maybe cities in the future will look like this. I can't tell whether it is reality or illusion</li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8MN0o6RS9o">Times Square, New York City</a></p>



<li> This is Spark AR,Spark AR is an augmented reality production tool launched by Facebook, which allows users to freely create ar filters and share them directly on Facebook & instagram platform.</li>
