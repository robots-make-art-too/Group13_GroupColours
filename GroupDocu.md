<h1>Discussion:</h1>


According to the EECS_1720_GROUP_PROJECT.pdf, we saw some interesting elements like the huge cat. Therefore, we think AR can use in the daily life. We talked about AR technology and it is inspired by street art and a game called Pokemon Go. We can see color every day in our daily lives, We want to design an AR software that can identify the color of a place. For example, we use our mobile phone, turn on the AR software. If our AR software identifies someplace which is yellow, it will draw a smiling face on the place.
